## Introduction
**AqTrmns** (or Aq *Terminus*) is a remake of the *[Terminus][terminussite]* font created by [sheckley (Dimitar Toshkov Zhekov)][sheckley].

The main goal of **AqTrmns** is to provide a *true* and reliable scalable variant of [Terminus](terminussite) so it can even look pretty at larger sizes, and accommodate people with a higher screen pixel density.

#### Screenshots
These are some screenshots with *ao2* and *gq2* applied.  These images are provided to you from the [Terminus](terminusshots) site itself.

### Process
The process is quite simple once you get the hang of it, but it's just rather tedious and even more so if you have <abbr title="Obsessive Compulsive Disorder">OCD</abbr> because everything literally has to be *Pixel Perfect*!  It's a real pain in the ass when you notice one fucking thing is off. Sometimes it results in me redoing everything...

## Requirements
<sup>This needs to be populated once a script been made to install the font.</sup>

## Installation

## FAQ

This is what is stated for what [Terminus](terminussite) is on the [Main Page](terminussite).
> Terminus Font is a clean, fixed width bitmap font, designed for long (8 and more hours per day) work with computers.

Currently [Terminus](terminussite) is just a [Bitmap](bitmapfonts) font which is essentially an image being for each character.  [Bitmaps](bitmapfonts) are also known to be called *Fixed Width* fonts and *Raster Fonts*.

If you're reading this, you're wanting to know what a *Scalable* font is, and you may know scaling a font is usually done with [Bitmap](#what-is-a-bitmap?) fonts.

A lot of people probably wont know the term *Vector* or [Outline](outlinefonts) and know what they mean in the contexts of fonts.  In short these types of fonts are able to be *Scaled* without looking like shit.  I would explain how it's done but I only have a rough idea myself as I haven't really done that much research into it.

If you're being serious..  Just leave..

But if you're actually being serious here is a link to a wiki article..  I'm not even going to format it for you for your convinence.  Or even spell check this part.  If you can't figure out how to go to a link that you can't just click on (Even though you probably can) but are scared because it's words.. Just leave.

<h2><a name="icantspell">My Appriciation</a></h2>
> I would like to add that I thank you so much sheckley (Dimitar Toshkov Zhekov) for creating this wonderful font.  It is truly one of a kind.  I've always been very picky with fonts.  Once I first saw your font, I was sold instantly.  Despite the updates prior to v4.40 being 3 years and this being a bitmap font..  Even though I had a lot of troubles trying to get this font to work when I first found it..  I have learned a lot about the work that goes into creating a font.  This has inspired me; you have inspired me to create my own font and learn about what it takes to actually creat a font and all the work.  It really is a lot of work and I am just getting started. I have a lot of work ahead of me, but I know it will be worth it.<p>My goal is port your font over so it's scalable and still looks pretty at larger sizes.  I am aware that there is applications that can trace the gylphs such as Potrace and AutoTrace, but they do not nearly do the justice that you and this font deserve.</p><p>Once again, thank you for all of your hard work.  I was hoping send you an email but there was no contact information to do so. I really hope you see this beacuse as said..  You deserve the appriciation.</p><p>**Anonrate**</p>
