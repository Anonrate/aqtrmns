AqTrmns - (Terminus Font - This is what you've been looking for)

I've still a lot of work to do, so I'm just going to say this for now.

I would like to add that I thank you so much sheckley (Dimitar Toshkov Zhekov) for creating this wonderful font.  It is truly one of a kind.  I've always been very picky with fonts.  Once I first saw your font, I was sold instantly.  Despite the updates prior to v4.40 being 3 years and this being a bitmap font..  Even though I had a lot of troubles trying to get this font to work when I first found it..  I have learned a lot about the work that goes into creating a font.  This has inspired me; you have inspired me to create my own font and learn about what it takes to actually creat a font and all the work.  It really is a lot of work and I am just getting started.  I have a lot of work ahead of me, but I know it will be worth it.

My goal is port your font over so it's scalable and still looks pretty at larger sizes.  I am aware that there is applications that can trace the gylphs such as Potrace and AutoTrace, but they do not nearly do the justice that you and this font deserve.

Once again, thank you for all of your hard work.  I was hoping send you an email but there was no contact information to do so.  I really hope you see this beacuse as said..  You deserve the appriciation.
