Version 4.46 contains 1291 characters, covers about 120 language sets and supports ISO8859-1/2/5/7/9/13/15/16, Paratype-PT154/PT254, KOI8-R/U/E/F, Esperanto, many IBM, Windows and Macintosh code pages, as well as the IBM VGA, vt100 and xterm pseudographic characters.+AAoACgAA-Sizes: 6x12, 8x14, 8x16, 10x18, 10x20, 11x22, 12x24, 14x28 and 16x32.+AAoA-Weights: normal and bold (except for 6x12), plus CRT VGA-bold for 8x14 and 8x16.+AAoACgAA-Screenshots (with ao2 and gq2 applied)+AAoA-http://terminus-font.sourceforge.net/shots.html+AAoACgAA-Character variants+AAoACgAA-ao1 ao1 +AD0A>  ao2 ao2 - nice, but sometimes hard to distinguish from 'o'.+AAoACgAA-dv2 dv2 +AD0A> dv1 dv1 - due to character matrix limitations, the printing de and ve are of slightly worse quality.+AAoACgAA-ge1 ge1 +AD0A> ge2 ge2 - only for 0433, 0453 and 0491, not 0493 and 0495+AAoACgAA-gq1 gq1 +AD0A> gq2 gq2 - some programs still use ` and ' as single quotes.+AAoACgAA-ij2 ij2 +AD0A> ij1 ij1 (also short i)+AAoACgAA-ka1 ka1 +AD0A> ka2 ka2 - the high cyrillic ka is used as decorative in Bulgaria; the latin 'k' is always high, of course.+AAoACgAA-ll1 ll1 +AD0A> ll2 ll2 - should pass the il1I test (depends on your resolution and monitor quality), but the horizontal alignment is a bit worse.+AAoACgAA-td2 td2 +AD0A> td1 td1 - perhaps td1 should be the default+AAoACgAA-hi1 hi1 +AD0A> hi2 hi2 - higher upper case letters, digits etc. for size 18 - looks better, but there is even less space between the lines.+AAoACgAA-br2 br2 +AD0A> br1 br1 - a bit more similar to Braille. X11 only, no Windows code page includes unicode range 2800-28FF.+AAoACgAA-Downloads:+AAoA* Unix/Linux source http://sourceforge.net/projects/terminus-font/files/terminus-font-4.46/terminus-font-4.46.tar.gz/download+AAoA* Windows Installer http://sourceforge.net/projects/terminus-font/files/terminus-font-4.46/terminus-font-4.46.exe/download+AAoA* View All Files http://sourceforge.net/projects/terminus-font/files/+AAoACgAA-Linux binary packages: check your distribution repository.+AAoACgAA-FAQ+AAoA-Q. Italic version?+AAoA-A. No. The quality is significantly lower, and preserving the font width requires overlapping characters, which are not handled very well by X11/Xft. Anyway, the modern GUIs support automatic slanting; if you are not satisfied with it, try mkitalic from FreeBSD or bdfslant from Debian.+AAoACgAA-Q. Scalable version?+AAoA-A. Long story short, when the average display resolution becomes at least 150 DPI. Prefferably 200.+AAoACgAA-Q. How about some new characters?+AAoA-A. Contact me and be ready to help.+AAoACgAA-Q. The bold 6x12 font...+AAoA-A. ...does not exist, there is no space for a bold font in a 6x12 matrix. However, the +ACIA-normal+ACIA font is somewhere between.+AAoACgAA-Q. The font works in X11/Motif, but not in GNOME/KDE/Xfce.+AAoA-A. Try adding 75-yes-terminus.conf to the Fontconfig configuration files. See also: mkfontscale(1), mkfontdir(1), fc-cache(1), xorg.conf(5), xfs(1), xlsfonts(1), fonts-conf(5) etc.+AAoACgAA-Q. The Windows executable contains a virus!+AAoA-A. With millions of Windows threats (at least signatures), and 40+- different scanners, the false positives are not rare. The executable is a valid zip archive, so you can open it and extract terminus.fon instead of running the installer. Or you can check it at Jotti Virusscan (http://virusscan.jotti.org/), VirusTotal (http://www.virustotal.com/) etc.+AAoACgAA-Legal information+AAoACgAA-Terminus Font is licensed under the SIL Open Font License, Version 1.1. The license is included as OFL.TXT, and is also available with a FAQ at http://scripts.sil.org/OFL+AAoACgAA-The font includes two variants of unicode range 2800-28FF, but does not support Braille in any way.+AAoACgAA-The files configure, configure.help, bdftopsf.pl, ucstoany.pl, fcp.c and terminus.nsi are distributed under the GNU General Public License version 2.0 or (at your choice) any later version.+AAoACgAA-THE END+AAoACgAA-I would like to add that I thank you so much sheckley (Dimitar Toshkov Zhekov) for creating this wonderful font.  It is truly one of a kind.  I've always been very picky with fonts.  Once I first saw your font, I was sold instantly.  Despite the updates prior to v4.40 being 3 years and this being a bitmap font..  Even though I had a lot of troubles trying to get this font to work when I first found it..  I have learned a lot about the work that goes into creating a font.  This has inspired me; you have inspired me to create my own font and learn about what it takes to actually creat a font and all the work.  It really is a lot of work and I am just getting started.  I have a lot of work ahead of me, but I know it will be worth it.+AAoACgAA-My goal is port your font over so it's scalable and still looks pretty at larger sizes.  I am aware that there is applications that can trace the gylphs such as Potrace and AutoTrace, but they do not nearly do the justice that you and this font deserve.+AAoACgAA-Once again, thank you for all of your hard work.  I was hoping send you an email but there was no contact information to do so.  I really hope you see this beacuse as said..  You deserve the appriciation.+AAoACgAA-Anonrate"

(Not including SuperScript and SubScript Numerics)+AAoA-I'm considering depeding on how the SuperScript and SubScript characters look, using just straight outlines could quite possible look better visually.+AAoACgAA-08-14-2017:+AAoA-Finally have the base done, but there are still imporvmemnts to be done."
